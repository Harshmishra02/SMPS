# SMPS
Switch Mode Power Supply (Boost Converter)

 
Switch mode power supply is an efficient technology for providing DC Power 
(Voltage and Current) to various Electrical and Electronics Devices. Switch 
mode power supplies are also known as SMPS for short. In present time they 
have replaced liner power supplies and became the most essential part of 
Electrical and Electronics engineering. Some of the advantages of switch mode 
power supply (SMPS) are listed below: 

Lighter weight

Small in size

Very high efficiency (Low losses) 

Low cost price

Provide isolation between input and output (Not for all)

Multiple outputs

# Working Principle: 
Switch mode power supplies work on the switching action of electronic devices 
(such as Diode, BJT, JFET, MOSFET and IGBT etc). Thus main principle of 
SMPS is on and off electronic devices. Due to this on and off of electronic 
devices, switch mode power supply have some on and off frequency. This on 
and off frequency of electronic components is called the operating frequency of 
switch mode power supply. Every switch mode power supply works on high 
frequency. The operating frequency of power supplies is (10 KHz to 20 KHz). 
They use Ferrite core inductors or transformers for high frequency operation. 
Due to use of ferrite material for the core of inductors and transformer, switch 
mode power supplies are lighter and small in size.
